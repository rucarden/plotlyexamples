  Your intention is to make the plots in Matlab, however much of what you want to do in plotly can be accomplished in javascript.  The interaction between plotly and matlab focuses mainly on translating a matlab plot into a plotly graph.  Some of these example will assume that there already exists a plotly that has been created by other means.<br>
